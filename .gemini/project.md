# Artemis Project Overview

Artemis is an AI-driven "Pod-Clipper" engine designed to automate the process of extracting viral clips from long-form videos (like podcasts).

## Core Mission
To provide a seamless pipeline from a video URL to a set of high-quality, social-media-ready clips, identifying the most engaging moments using advanced AI.

## Main Workflow
1. **Submit**: Users provide a video URL via the web interface.
2. **Analyze**: Gemini 1.5/2.0 Flash analyzes audio and visual cues.
3. **Clip**: FFmpeg performs precise cuts based on AI timestamps.
4. **Deliver**: Clips are stored and presented to the user with AI-generated titles and viral scores.

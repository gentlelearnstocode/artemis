# Product Guidelines: Artemis

## Brand Personality
Artemis is **Creative & Energetic**. We are focused on viral trends, social media excitement, and helping creators make their content "pop" and stand out in crowded feeds.

## Voice and Tone
The primary tone is **Playful & Informal**. We use modern social media culture as our language, incorporating informal phrasing and emojis where appropriate to build a connection with our creator community. The documentation and UI should feel like a savvy creative partner rather than a rigid tool.

## Visual Identity
- **High-Energy & Bold:** Our interface uses vibrant colors (like neon accents) and high-contrast elements.
- **Dynamic Interactions:** Use animations and transitions that reflect the fast-paced nature of social media to make the app feel alive and responsive.
- **Trend-Aware:** The design should feel modern and "of the moment," aligning with current aesthetic trends on platforms like TikTok and Instagram.
